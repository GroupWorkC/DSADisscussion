Naive Approach -->  1. T1 and T2 two trees are given with size N and M.

                    2. Find any traversal of both trees.

                    3. If traversal of both trees are same then return true otherwise false.

                    Since we are traversing both trees individually then,

                    Time Complexity --> O(N + M).


Optimised Approach --> Traverse both trees simultaneously.

Algorithm -->   1. Create a recursive function 'isIdentical(n1, n2)' which takes nodes of two trees i.e. n1 and n2;

                    a. If any of the node is NULL and other is not, return false.

                    b. If both nodes are NULL, return true.

                    c. If data of both nodes are not equal, return false.

                    d. Return isIdentical(n1->left, n2->left) && isIdentical(n1->right, n2->right);

                    Since we need to traverse both trees simultaneously and if trees are of different sizes, then we traverse only small tree. Therefore,

                    Time Complexity --> O(min(N, M)).
