String is palindrome or not : https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/palindrome-string0817/1?page=1&category[]=Strings&sortBy=submissions 


Algorithm -> Optimal Solution (My Approach)

	1. We start by declaring two pointers One from last and another from starting i.e (int low,int high)
	
	2. Then we iterate over the given string(S) with these pointers and loop over till (low <= high) is true.

	3. When we iterating the string we compare the character at index low and index high. The point at which these 
	   characters become unequal we return false otherwise true.
