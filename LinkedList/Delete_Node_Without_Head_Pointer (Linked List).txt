Delete Node Without a Head Pointer --: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/delete-without-head-pointer/1?page=1&category[]=Linked%20List&sortBy=submissions

Context : The Node which we have to Delete is given.

Algorithm -:

Approach : 

	Step 1: We can have any node so to delete it we have to focus on its value/data which it contains.

	Step 2: Now to change the value we can copy the value of next node to the node which we want to delete,
		and this we will do to all the node till the second last node.

	Step 3: As we get the second last node and the value from the last node is came to this node. Now we 
		refrence this secondlast node to null (secondLast.next = null) in the end.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Code (Java) By Me :

void deleteNode(Node del)
    {
        if(del.next==null)
            del=null;
            
         while(true){
             del.data = del.next.data;
             if(del.next.next==null)
                break;
            
            del = del.next;
         }
         
         del.next=null;
    }
